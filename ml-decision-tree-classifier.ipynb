    "In my implementation, the decision tree uses information gain as the splitting criterion. Information Gain prefers splits that maximize class separation by reducing entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another splitting criterion is Gini impurity, which measures how \"mixed up\" the data is at a certain point in the decision tree. If a node has a mix of different classes, the impurity is high. If a node has mostly one class, the impurity is low. Using Gini impurity, when the decision tree splits the data, it tries to reduce impurity—meaning it wants to make the groups as \"pure\" as possible. Gini tends to prefer splits that make big groups, rather than breaking data into many small groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Gini impurity may lead to different tree structures since it prioritizes larger homogeneous groups.\n",
    "Also accuracy may change but would be similar to current accuracy (made with informational gain splitting criterion).\n"

    "##### 2. Can the Test Procedure Indicate Overfitting or Underfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the test procedure helps identify overfitting or underfitting by comparing model performance on training data vs. test data.\n",
    "If the model performs well against the training data (high accuracy or F1-score) but has much lower accuracy or F1-score against the test data, this could indicate overfitting.\n",
    "If both training and test accuracy are low, the model is too simple to capture patterns in the data. A shallow tree may underfit if it does not split enough to separate different classes effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth 2: Training and test accuracy are quite similar (~81.7% vs. ~81.5%), meaning the model is not overfitting.\n",
    "Depth 3: Training accuracy increases (~82.8%) and test accuracy slightly improves (~82.0%), so the tree is generalizing well.\n",
    "Depth 4: Training accuracy jumps to 84.6%, but test accuracy drops (~81.0%). This suggests overfitting—the model is too tailored to training data and loses generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that tree with depth 3 provides the best balance between complexity and performance, while deeper trees may begin to overfit to the training data."
